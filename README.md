# Development & Problem Solving Process

-I wanted to design a workout applicatuon because its something Ive used before, and felt like it was something I could create because ive used one, and understand it.
-The back end was fine for me, except for change password. My priorities to to get sign-up and sign in. I got stuck not being able to retrieve my workouts, and lost sight of all of the other basic issues such as not changing over the error messages/color to their respective place.


# Unsolved Problems
I still had trouble with the readme.
- readme file wont update on back end repo.
